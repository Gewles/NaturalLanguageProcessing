        For the Final Project of the Natural Language Processing course, I am choosing to conduct analysis on spam detection. Naturally, this topic is important and holds many real-world applications, as spam is annoying and ideally we can create an alorithim that can detect, filter, and flag spam messages for a better user experience. 

        Previously, I wanted to do sentiment analysis on texts between my significant other and I, but I soon realized that this approach would be a little too personal for this class, so I redirected my topic interest into a more pragmatic application.
