## Sources of the dataset 

a. Where did you get the data? 

  **The dataset is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.**

b. How did you get the data?

  **From the UCI Machine Learning Repository, there is availability to download the dataset.**

c. What is the license of the data if any? 
  
  **The dataset was sourced from the UK forum in which cell phone users make public claims about SMS spam messages,

### Data models and data structures 

a. What are the data models used in the dataset? 

**I will continue with a classification question, using methods intoduced in the course, such as Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression, possibly extending
further into Decision Trees.**



b. What are the data structures used in the dataset?

**Both variables are strings**
